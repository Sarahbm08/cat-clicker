# Cat Clicker Premium PRO

Sarah Morley's cat clicker project from Udacity's MVO course.

# Features

The program has a list of cat names on the left, with the current cat displayed in the main area. The cat's name and number of clicks is also displayed. The number of clicks increments each time you click on the picture of the cat. To change the current cat, click on a different name from the list.

This also features an admin button, where you can change the current cat's name, picture url, and number of clicks.
